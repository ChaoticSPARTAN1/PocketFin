"""Adaptive picture quality for network streams (Wi-Fi to the Chromatic, link to the Pocket).

The encoder makes every picture at up to three JPEG qualities in one pass (see
`ladder()` and `stream_command(..., ladder=...)`), so the gateway can change quality
on any picture: no restart, no new session, no gap. The lowest level also sends every
other picture. Audio, frame size and the title's cadence never change, so a slow
network softens the picture instead of stopping playback.

The signal needs nothing from the client: the gateway compares how fast the client
takes audio (the media clock) with real time. A client that keeps up takes at least
real time, whether it is filling its buffer or pacing a full one; one that falls below
that is limited by the network. Gaps (pause, seek, loading) reset the measurement.
Moving back up is a probe that backs off if it fails, so quality does not oscillate.
